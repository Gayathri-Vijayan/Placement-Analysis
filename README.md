# Placement-Analysis
The dataset is about placement details in a particular college. It includes the information about
gender, percentage and Board name of secondary education, percentage, stream and Board name
of higher secondary education, Undergraduate field and percentage, work experience of certain
students. The status column shows whether the student is placed or not and the corresponding
salary if they are placed.

We can infer that male cadets are more likely to be placed and in non-placed categories also their
count is more. Even if there is no work experience they are getting placed. The board of the
previous school has not much impact on the placement.

Most of the cadets got a salary package around 3 lakhs

While comparing the stream of higher secondary education and the salary science students are
get much salary while arts students tends to get much low salary

The students with a percentage around 65-75 are much likely to get placed.  

Marketing and finance (Mkt&Fin) students are getting much higher salaries than marketing and
HR (Mkt&HR)

From the given dataset , its properties and various information regarding the same is inferred. It
has got 215 rows and 15 columns. The null values are handled.The factors influencing the
placement and salary could be visualized. Some factors are found to be crucial but there are
some factors which don't seem to be much significant. For the classification purpose Random
forest classifier was chosen which is much better than a single decision tree . Hence using the
same an accuracy of 90% is obtained from the prediction.
